<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
posted by BGB, November 15, 2016
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking
technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</<i><dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vaccum-sealed in plastic) into a
water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>

<p>Location: Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
Hours:<br>Tuesday to Saturday, <time
datetime="11:00">11am</time>
to 
<time
datetime+11:00>11pm</time></p>
